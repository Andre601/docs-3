A modpack is a list of mods bundled with additional files, such as configuration files. In general, it's a modded instance of a game ready to play, or with minor changes.

## How do I create a modpack?

## How do I play a modpack?

Currently, the only way to play a Modrinth modpack is via [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com).

### ATLauncher

If you have a direct link to a Modrinth pack, you can also import it using the "Import" button in the "Instances" tab.
