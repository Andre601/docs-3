# Playing Modpacks

A modpack is a list of mods bundled with additional files, such as configuration files. In general, it's a modded instance of a game ready to play, or with minor changes.

## How do I create a modpack?

Please see the guide for [creating modpacks](creating_modpacks.md).

## How do I play a modpack?

Currently, the only way to play a Modrinth modpack is via [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com).

### ATLauncher

ATLauncher is a launcher focused on easy integration of modpacks with various different platforms.

Modrinth packs can be installed using ATLauncher in as few as three clicks. Go to the "Packs" tab, select Modrinth on the left, and search for the pack you want. Then, play!

If you just want to insert an ID, slug, or URL directly, you can also do so using the "Add Manually" button by the top-right of the search

If you have a direct link to a Modrinth pack, you also have the option of importing it using the "Import" button in the "Instances" tab.
